# Changelog
All notable changes to the Meta-Union Minecraft Network will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). You can find a prettier version of these changelogs [here](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Meta-Union/changelog/main&homepage=changelog.md&sidebar=true#/) unless you are already on Docsify-This, then you're already "here" :joy:

## 2025-10-19
### Changed
- You previously did not lose hunger while you were in your own town which was not intended to be the case. Now you do lose hunger while you're in your own town (survival)

## 2025-10-18
### Changed
- The message shown when toggling PvP has been changed to reflect the fact that you're forced to be visible on the map and locator bar when your PvP status is on (survival)

## 2025-10-17
### Changed
- Capped the damage of maces at 10 as the mace can otherwise be too powerful and even one hit geared up and skilled up people (survival)

## 2025-10-15
### Changed
- You can no longer hide on the map or from the locator bar if you turn off PvP (survival)

## 2025-10-13
### Added
- 60 second spawn protection after you have been killed is now applied as it was deemed unfair that people can spawn camp you (survival)

## 2025-10-12
### Changed
- Server updated to run 1.21.10 (survival)
- Elite Coins are more common again (survival)

## 2025-10-10
### Changed
- Due to how Bedrock Edition handles the Haste effect differently from Java Edition, we changed the Speed Mine ability to give haste level 15 instead of 10 as level 10 was causing issues. Quite certainly related to <https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/3987> (survival)

## 2025-10-05
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug which prevented some auctions in the auction house to work (survival)
- Fixed a bug which made spectator mode not work properly (survival)
### Changed
- Ender Pearls will no longer load chunks even though this is vanilla behavior. The main reason is because it conflicts with the idea of Meta-Union which is that "real work" should be rewarded and not being AFK and also rules which prevent gaining resources while AFK which would be circumvented by ender pearls loading chunks (survival)

## 2025-10-03
### Changed
- PvP plugin has been updated to a new major version bringing a better timer which tells you how long you're in combat still and a better internal way of handling placeholders (this is only relevant for Folas xD). If you notice anything weird about it, let me know (survival)
- Having PvP turned on now grants an extra 70 MetaCoins every 6 minutes (survival)

## 2025-09-24
### Changed
- Some commands now work different internally but nothing should have changed function wise (lobby, creative, survival)
### Fixed
- Lots of errors were thrown in the console if you were in a non-plot world as the name above your player shows how many plots you own **but** it can't be resolved if you are in a non-plot world, so now the "Plots Owned" above your head refers to only the new plot world and ignores the ones you have in the old plot world, hopefully not too inconvenient for people <3 (creative)

## 2025-09-23
### Added
- Elite Gear for Speed, Regeneration, Wisdom, Health and Luck were added. I won't be adding Toughness as in my opinion it's no different than extra Health, same goes for Crit Damage and Crit Chance only for Strength, so that also won't become a thing (survival)
### Changed
- The Recovery Compass is back as a few people have told me that they're missing it as it made it super easy to quickly join the server of your liking. Now the "Build by ..." NPCs tell you to use the other NPCs instead if you want to play (lobby)

## 2025-09-20
### Changed
- Elites now give Elite Coins to everyone who was involved in a fight although there is a limit which is the elite's level + 3, so a level 5 Elite could give a reward to a maximum of 8 people (survival)
- Elites can no longer be killed as easily with a mace (survival)
- Non-hostile mobs were removed from Elites and a replacement with hostile mobs was added so Elites can be fought within towns more easily (survival)
- You can now interact with the "Lobby built by ..." NPCs to open the menu (lobby)
### Removed
- You no longer receive a recovery compass when you enter the server. You will have to either interact with the NPCs, use the portals or type '/menu' AKA '/?' to join a server. This was mainly done because if both the compass and the NPCs open the menu, it would glitch out and if I write in chat to interact with the NPCs to play, that'll confuse new players as the "Build by ..." NPC is also an NPC but it won't do anything so this is the best solution in my opinion (lobby)

## 2025-09-16
### Added
- Elite Gear was added to the Server Shop which currently allows you to buy armor which gives extra strength stat points. More gear might follow in the future but only on demand, so it won't be added without anyone asking (survival)
### Changed
- The spawn has gotten a little overhaul to hopefully make things even easier for new players, especially the ones that do not want to read an entire tutorial before playing (survival)

## 2025-09-14
### Added
- New quest which allows you to earn Elite Cookies Lv. 1 if you're near other players. The system is still subject to change as it's obviously quite new still. This is meant to encourage more activities together other than just fishing (survival)
### Removed
- Group Fishing was removed as it's now replaced by the Group Elite system that you unlock through the quest (survival)

## 2025-09-11
### Changed
- Looting 5 is now instead Looting 6 (survival)
- Phantoms spawned from the spawn eggs from the server shop no longer drop phantom membranes as otherwise with the high levels of Looting you can gain an unlimited amount of phantom membranes (survival)
### Added
- Looting 9 can be bought from the server shop (survival)

## 2025-09-09
### Changed
- '/local' now works and has a radiud of 128 blocks (creative)

## 2025-09-08
### Changed
- Treecapitator and Speed Mine abilities have been doubled in how long they last. Some people that shall remain unnamed complained that it didn't feel like it lasted very long :P (survival)
### Added
- Looting 5 was added as a custom enchantment for 100 levels. More might be coming soon (survival)

## 2025-09-07
### Added
- Added the first challenge which is to smelt all ores. This could mark the start of a cool new system which will be challenges but it might as well just be scrapped eventually as it doesn't catch on or whatever other reason... only time will tell :> (survival)

## 2025-09-06
### Changed
- Creating a outpost for a town now costs 24,000 while it previously costed 50,000 (survival)
- Merging towns now costs 12,000 while it previously costed 25,000 (survival)

## 2025-09-05
### Changed
- Totem of Undying and Phantom Spawn Eggs can now be obtained from the Server Shop instead of quests. It seems much more logical that way (survival)
- The Dragon Egg quest was moved to the More Content category as it was the only quest left in the Vanilla Content category, so there wasn't much reason for a category to exist just for one quest (survival)
- Menues like Custom Enchantments, Crates, Resources, Spawn Eggs, Others and Skulls were all put into one menu button which is now called "Server Shop" as all the former mentioned menu buttons are basically just a server shop in a different fasion (survival)
- The Elites button now directly leads to the Elite Cookies menu as all the other ones were moved to the Server Shop (survival)
- StatTrak Creator was moved from the Others server shop to the Custom Enchantments as the Others server shop really only had the StatTrak Creator and Mana Potions. Mana Potions were removed entirely as I don't see anyone using them (survival)

## 2025-09-01
### Changed
- Some internal changes to how the welcome message of new players is handled (lobby)
- Some internal changes to how the items you're given is handled. I also made the name and lore of the Recovery Compass look a little nicer (lobby)

## 2025-08-31
### Changed
- Elytra Unbreaking enchantments can now be bought in '/menu' -> Custom Enchantments instead of '/menu' -> Elite -> Custom Enchantments. It seemed a little disconnedted and confusing that way. I hope this won't be an inconvenience to anyone (survival)
- Elytra Unbreaking enchantments have been lowered to level 12, 24 and 48 to actually double the durability of the elytra. Also level 70 seemed a little too strong in terms of how long it makes your elytra last. This could still be subject to change but at least for a little while I'd like to try these numbers. Elytras with existing Unbreaking 70 will stay that way and not lower their enchantment level! (survival)
### Added
- Fancy Diamond Sword Crate 2 has been released and it costs 1 MetaCoin and 1 Diamond Sword to open (survival)

## 2025-08-30
### Removed
- The bidding functionality of the auction house was removed as it wasn't used much and I'm afraid it might lead to confusion of how it works (survival)
### Changed
- The bottom right book of the auction house now explains how to use '/ah sell \<price\>' instead of being rather vague about it (survival)
### Added
- You can now either use '/togglelocatorbar' or go into the '/menu' -> World Related and toggle it from there (survival)
- You can now also toggle if you're hidden or shown on the online map again (survival)

## 2025-08-29
### Fixed
- The NPCs Diamond_Sam, LenaTheEevee and an_normal_human for some reason had lost their skins a while ago and I wasn't able to fix it. Today I managed to fix this (by simply using their UUID in the command instead of the name which I wouldn't expect to make a difference but apparently it does) (survival)

## 2025-08-28
### Added
- You can now buy 1 Elite Cookie for 300 vanilla levels in the Elite Cookie Shop (survival)
### Changed
- TSMs are now called PSMs as TSM stood for Toggleable Skill Multiplier and now they're Permanent Skill Multipliers. This will make the whole system simpler as they'll be always active and also they no longer cost a bit of your salary (survival)
- You now get 2 stacks of gunpowder instead of 1 for 1 Elite Coin (survival)

## 2025-08-07
### Added
- New Tutorial book called "Plot Commands" to explain different plot commands like '/plot visit ...' and some more. This should help the people that want to visit other plots or want to get back to their own plots (creative)

## 2025-07-28
### Added
- '/locatorbar color \<hex code\>' to set the color of your locator bar icon (survival, creative)
- '/locatorbar color reset' to reset the color of your locator bar icon (survival, creative)

## 2025-07-26
### Changed
- Armor Trims are now an allowed NBT compound (creative)
- Boss kills needed for TSMs previously were "Warden, Elder Guardian, Wither, Ender Dragon" and have now been changed to "Elder Guardian, Ender Dragon, Wither, Warden" in that order. This was mainly done to reflect the difficulty of each mob (survival)

## 2025-07-24
### Changed
- Updated all servers to 1.21.8 (survival, creative, lobby)

## 2025-07-22
### Changed
- Graves plugin was swapped out as the old one had bugs and was no longer maintained (survival)
- Graves no longer require 50 MetaCoins to open, they're now free (survival)
- Graves spawn in towns now but they can't really be weaponized as they're free to open, a person has a max of 8 graves at one point and you can't collide with them, so it should be alright (survival)
- Most of the other features of graves stay the same (survival)

## 2025-07-19
### Changed
- Stone now has a chance of spawning a silverfish instead of a baby zombie (extreme)
### Added
- Silverfish drop 1 iron nugget when killed (extreme)

## 2025-07-18
### Changed
- Infinite water sources have been disabled (extreme)
- Villagers can no longer spawn (extreme)
- Wandering Traders can no longer spawn (extreme)
- You can no longer craft crafters or enchanting tables (extreme)
- Experience orbs no longer spawn from anywhere (extreme)

## 2025-07-12
### Removed
- Plots in creative are no longer shown on the online map, it was causing quite a lot of lag unfortunately (creative)

## 2025-07-10
### Changed
- Updated server to 1.21.7 - wooh, doggo painting!! :D (lobby, creative, survival)

## 2025-07-05
### Changed
- Updated server to 1.21.6 (creative, lobby)

## 2025-07-03
### Changed
- Updated server to 1.21.6 (survival)

## 2025-07-02
### Changed
- Particles to visualize the clipboard are no longer the scrape particle but redstone dust instead as scrape particles have a sound attached to them on Bedrock Edition which creates a **lot** of noise (creative)

## 2025-06-30
### Removed
- Title message that's shown every 6 minutes if you haven't voted within the last 24 hours was removed as its effects are questionable and we hopefully have a new incentive to get people to vote. It's still greatly appreciate every time you vote <3 (creative)
### Changed
- The old plugin that shows virtual books like in the Tutorial menu was removed as it's been replaced with something else (creative, survival)

## 2025-06-28
### Fixed
- Debug sticks would often complain about being an illegal item, that should now be fixed (creative)

## 2025-06-11
### Fixed
- Found out that regular users couldn't actually open crates as the permissions were bound to a role but said role was only obtained by doing a quest which was removed some time ago... sorry about that, crates should now be available to anyone! (survival)

## 2025-06-09
### Changed
- Sniffer sizes now only range from 1.3 to 0.5 as opposed to the previous 2.0 to 0.5. This change had to be made as bigger size sniffers can't breed due to a Mojang/Minecraft bug: <https://report.bugs.mojang.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/MC-298644>. This will be reverted whenever Mojang fixes said issue (survival)
### Added
- More items with custom models have been added through various means, mostly skill related (survival)

## 2025-06-06
### Changed
- Fishing rods with custom models/skins will now have increased durability shown in the lore which is based on the quality (survival)

## 2025-06-02
### Added
- 2 Netherite Scraps can now be bought for 1 Elite Coin (survival)

## 2025-06-01
### Added
- Collectible Cards Crate 1. It contains almost 100 collectible cards! (survival)

## 2025-05-31
### Changed
- '/vote' now looks slightly different and uses the Meta-Union default color scheme. It also now explains a little more what voting really does for Meta-Union <3 (lobby, creative, survival)
- The Steed Speed quest now grants mobs you mount a 10 minute speed 2 effect. The effect also ends when you dismount. This was changed because the quest was added when elytras were still banned, so getting around faster was rather unique but now I thought I should do horses etc justice by boosting them even outside of paths (survival)

## 2025-05-29
### Changed
- Elite Cookies now only cost 2,500 MetaCoins instead of 5,000 MetaCoins. They seemed a little expensive currently, making most people prefer fishing over the Elites (survival)
- You can now use the auction house from any chunk of a town, not just the shop plot (survival)

## 2025-05-25
### Fixed
- If you had a potion effect applied that was longer than vanilla default, it was removed when disconnecting or going to the hub. That is no longer the case now and was actually never meant to be the case. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused (survival)

## 2025-05-23
### Added
- Chest Shops are back!! (survival)
- Fancy Diamond Sword Crate has been added which I have asked about in a Discord poll before (survival)
- The Elytra crate can be bought with a dragon head again, additionally to the one you can buy for an Elytra (survival)

## 2025-05-18
### Changed
- If you use '/ah' outside a shop plot now, you'll get a book opened that explains how it works. The previous message in chat wasn't quite enough to really make everyone understand how auction houses work (survival)

## 2025-05-17
### Changed
- Server was updated to 1.21.5 (creative)
- Skulls are working again (survival)
- You can no longer hide on the online map (survival)

## 2025-05-15
### Changed
- You can no longer combine two Unbreaking 4 custom enchantment books to make an Unbreaking 5 custom enchantment book in an anvil. This was never intended to happen and was only made possible due to me allowing the use of anvils to add enchantments to items but it was never meant to be used to improve the enchantment's level itself. The same goes for any other Unbreaking custom enchantment book (survival)

## 2025-05-13
### Fixed
- You could previously buy crates with a full inventory which lead to you paying money and the crate telling you you can't open it with a full inventory. That's now been fixed and you're required to have an empty inventory slot before the crate even opens (survival)
### Changed
- The Diamond Sword Crate 1 has been changed. You now have to pay one unchanged, unenchanted diamond sword and 1,000 MetaCoins to get a diamond sword with a skin. This change will eventually be done to all the crates except plushies (survival)
### Added
- New WorldEdit visualizer with particles which is (according to me) better than the old one. We also decided it needs new particles which have been chosen by the community (creative)

## 2025-05-10
### Added
- New system has been installed to prevent crash items, force OP signs and similar illegal items. If you find any (legitimate) issues with this system, please let me know (creative)
### Changed
- A different plugin to visualize WorldEdit selections as the old one was not open source but the new one is! \o/ (creative)

## 2025-05-03
### Changed
- The elytras with higher durability were swapped out for custom enchantments that only work on elytras. That makes it possible to also have longer lasting elytras with custom skins (survival)

## 2025-05-02
### Added
- Due to high demand, I've added elytras with 2x, 5x and 10x the regular durability to the Elite Shop, enjoy! (survival)

## 2025-05-01
### Added
- Level 10 and 11 Elite Cookies (survival)

## 2025-04-28
### Added
- PvP button to toggle PvP from the '/menu' (survival)

## 2025-04-23
### Changed
- PvP can now be toggled again with '/togglepvp'. PvP is turned on by default (survival)
- Technically we're using a different PvP plugin again (survival)
- The PvP status now ignores the PvP setting of a town or rather, technically speaking, towns have PvP force on but if you toggle it off, that'll override the forced on PvP of a town (survival)
### Removed
- '/killstats' is no longer a command as it was a feature of the old plugin which we swapped out (survival)

## 2025-04-20
### Added
- Votes now have a 10% chance to pay 4,000 MetaCoins (creative)
- Votes now have a 10% chance to pay 2,000 MetaCoins (survival)
### Removed
- Quests no longer increases how much money you earn from voting and any previously gained advantage is obsolete (survival)
- Quests no longer grant 2,000 MetaCoins for things like sprinting, farming, chopping trees and so on. It simply felt like favoring certain activities while others weren't and if I wanted to keep it balanced, I would have needed to add an infinite amount of quests which would have to be expanded on every update (survival)

## 2025-04-18
### Added
- 3 more levels of Elites, up to level 9 now (survival)

## 2025-04-16
### Added
- 3 more levels of Elites (survival)

## 2025-04-13
### Changed
- The Strike enchantment no longer deals damage to players, mobs or blocks nearby (survival)
- You now have to put custom enchantments on items through the anvil, just like in vanilla (survival)
### Removed
- The Strike enchantment was removed from the menu so it can no longer be obtained (survival)
- Curse of Masking had to be removed as you could otherwise enchant a stack of player heads with just one book. Hopefully we'll find a replacement at some point (survival)

## 2025-04-08
### Added
- Plushy Crate has been added for only 1k MetaCoins! (survival)
### Changed
- Newly obtained plushies can now be worn on your head (survival)

## 2025-04-04
### Added
- Elite Cookies can now be bought in '/menu' -> Elites for 5k MetaCoins. These cookies spawn an Elite where you stand and currently there are 3 levels. Expect more in the future! (survival)

## 2025-04-02
### Changed
- Newly spawned mobs should no longer burn in sunlight (creative)
- Newly spawned ghasts can be killed again (creative)

## 2025-03-30
### Added
- You can now see everyone on all servers in the tab list (except lobby2 and test servers). It still needs some final touches but the feature generally works and you can finally see at a glance who's online again! (all servers)

## 2025-03-24
### Changed
- Elite Spawn rates increase. Overworld went from 1% to 2%. Nether went from 2% to 3%. End went from 3% to 4%. (survival)

## 2025-03-22
### Changed
- The menu and all sub-menues provided by Meta-Union have received a facelift. Other servers will follow :) (creative)
- Please make sure to read '/rules' again. Rule 12 was added, some of the clarifications were changed and added onto and some rules slightly rewritten! (all servers)
- The '/rules' menu has gotten a new look, you might want to check it out (all servers)

## 2025-03-20
### Changed
- The economy plugin was changed but all the money was migrated to the new one so nothing was lost. Currently you have to use commands that start with '/money' such as '/money pay <user> <amount>' to pay someone but on the next restart '/pay' and '/bal' and the likes will be back (survival, creative)

## 2025-03-16
### Added
- MobTrak can now be obtained from killing mobs. These items act like the FishTrak but they track how many mobs you've killed with the weapon. The current chance to get one is 1 in 1,000 but this number is affected by your luck stat and the chance might vary over time (survival)
- BlockTrak can now be obtained from Mining, Excavating or Farming. BlockTrak tracks how many mobs you've killed with a weapon. I won't mention the chances cause they're different for each skill and might also be changed over time (survival)
- StatTrak can now be bought in the Others category of the Elite Shop for 16 Elite Coins (survival)
- Fishing rods with custom model data you get from fishing now have a quality which can range between 1 and 100. It has no technical meaning though (survival)

## 2025-03-13
### Added
- You now earn extra money when near other players. For now it's an extra 15% of income when there are 2 or more players within 64 blocks. Any AFK players are not taken into the equation at all. (survival)
- Rule 11 now clearly states that you're not allowed to use alts to earn extra resources, coins or anything similar (all servers)
### Changed
- The salary message now only states that you earned money, not how much as with the new system it can get confusing for players to see earning more or less with no clear indication as to why (survival)

## 2025-03-12
### Changed
- Pretty much all quests that used to be related to skills have been changed. They no longer reward skill exp as that throws off the balance of which tasks for certain skills are most beneficial. Also some of the quest categories have been reworked (survival)

## 2025-03-09
### Added
- Curse of Masking has been added to the Custom Enchantments. It'll add Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing to any player head (survival)
### Changed
- Crates are now unlocked after 25 hours instead of requiring 25,000 MetaCoins in your '/bal'. Only really active players were likely to reach the 25k and even some of those would deposit their money into the town and thus never unlocking crates. The new requirement of 25 hours makes it possible for anyone to unlock them while not having to specifically aim for it (survival)

## 2025-03-09
### Changed
- The quest to unlock chest shops has been removed and everyone was given the permission to create up to 100 as that's the maximum. This was mainly done because people often got confused how to unlock chest shops and they had forgotten about quests at all at that point (survival)
- The tutorial book on chest shops was updated (survival)
- The quest to unlock custom enchantments has been removed and everyone was given the permission to see and open the custom enchantments button in '/menu' (survival)

## 2025-03-05
### Changed
- The quest to unlock hiding on the map has been removed and everyone was given the permission to use both '/map hide' and '/map show' as well as see the buttons in the menu. This was mainly done because due to PvP it's now much more important to be able to hide on the map (survival)
### Added
- Elite Fishing. That means you'll now have a chance to earn Elite Coins when you're fishing with someone else nearby, up to 4 players in total where the chance also increases the more players you are! (survival)

## 2025-03-03
### Fixed
- Shops that sell or buy more than 1 item now show the proper prices in the GUI (survival)
- Shops now update their signs again as they should (survival)
- Decapitation used to have 5, 10 and 15% chance for their respective levels while in the GUI it said it was 33, 66 and 100%. The enchantment is now actually properly set to 33, 66 and 100% (survival)
### Added
- Simple Voice Chat mod support. It might take a little bit until it's rolled out for everyone connecting but after at most 24 hours it should work for anyone connecting (all servers)

## 2025-02-28
### Added
- There is now a '/pvpstats [user]' command which tracks things such as kills, deaths and PvP points (survival)
- You now earn PvP points from killing people but you also lose them from dying in general, to more incentivise not dying constantly (survival)
- There is now '/killrecaps' which shows a list of recent PvP kills (survival)
- New Farming quest for sugar cane (survival)
### Changed
- Technically the PvP plugin was swapped out but should function almost identical to the old one except for the previously mentioned additions (survival)

## 2025-02-25
### Changed
- Anyone that's tagged due to PvP will be glowing during combat and stop glowing after combat (survival)

## 2025-02-23
### Added
- Elites for the end dimension have been added, being called End Elites. These will take at least 3 players to be killed and spawn quite frequently alongside endermen. They also have a guaranteed chance to drop an elite coin (survival)
### Changed
- Elites in the nether are now called Nether Elites (survival)

## 2025-02-22
### Changed
- You are now given the same "Changes You Must Know About" book when you join for the first time as the one you find in '/menu' -> Tutorials (survival)
### Added
- There is now a "Newbie Guide" in '/menu' -> Tutorial. This same book is also handed out to people that join for the first time. It explains all the most essential things we recommend you do on the server (survival)

## 2025-02-21
### Changed
- You can no longer glide with the elytra in the overworld or the nether. It's now only possible in the end dimension (survival)
- You can now boost an elytra with firework rockets just like in vanilla. The previous change still applies to this of course (survival)

## 2025-02-17
### Changed
- You can now change custom model data of items with '/ie custommodeldata <number>' instead of renaming it in the anvil (creative)
### Added
- Strength Gear has been added to the Elite Shop (survival)

## 2025-02-15
### Changed
- Due to some issues with the old plugin, the server now uses a new villager optimization plugin but it functions pretty much the same (survival)
- Villagers now only get optimized when called 'Optimize' (survival)
- You'll have to once more rename your villagers to 'Optimize' if you want to be able to trade with them again (survival)
### Removed
- Villagers no longer get optimized when standing on a brick block (survival)

## 2025-02-03
### Changed
- PvP is now turned on outside of towns with no option to opt-out (survival)
- PvP is turned off inside of towns by default but can be toggled on by using '/town toggle pvp' (survival)
- The menu button to toggle PvP has been removed (survival)
- The permission to toggle PvP with '/pvp' has been removed (survival)
- PvP death messages are now shown globally again (survival)
- PvP status is no longer shown next to the name above the player (survival)

## 2025-01-26
### Changed
- The merge radius of items was changed to 3. This means similar items will stack from farther away once again but only if their Y level is the same. This should hopefully reduce lag for some people and it will effectively change after a server restart (survival)
- Creative has been updated to 1.21.4 and along with it all its plugins have been, too (creative)
- More NPCs now have custom model items. We might also add them to the creative spawn soon enough :) (survival, lobby)

## 2025-01-23
### Added
- New, more sophisticated anti spam system which should work MUCH more efficiently against people sending messages in chat real fast (all servers)
### Fixed
- Items with custom model data did not give enchanting skill experience, now they do (survival)

## 2025-01-20
### Changed
- Mobs that die from suffocation no longer drop items because rescaled mobs drop their items too often and mobs like zombies pick up their loot and then can no longer despawn naturally (survival)
- The monster cap per player has been reduced from 28 to 22 which should hopefully result in less crowds of mobs near towns but still have enough mobs on the surface to be tough. This also means any monster farms have been reduced in output by roughly 20% (survival)
### Added
- 3 new quests for the excavation skill as the dirt quest was a little tedious to achieve as lots of people use dirt for terraforming and place it (survival)

## 2025-01-19
### Fixed
- You no longer stop being AFK immediately when you go AFK on a redstone ore, pressure plate or similar blocks (survival)
### Changed
- Slightly changed how the '/stuck' command works as there have been reports of it sometimes not giving the chorus fruit (survival)

## 2025-01-18
### Added
- '/changescale <0.01 - 16>' lets you change your own player's scale (creative)
### Changed
- Downloading the server resource pack is now handled slightly differently. You'll have to change if you want to have it enabled or disabled through the Minecraft server list from now on (all servers + proxy)

## 2025-01-17
### Added
- Added a new crate with custom skin axes (survival)

## 2025-01-16
### Added
- Rule 10 now states that you are not allowed to build traps of any kind. Although I think it already falls under respecting other players and building traps isn't doing so because you aren't respecting their PvP status, I still feel like it helps clarify it's against the rules (all servers)

## 2025-01-14
### Added
- 2 second cooldown on messages in global chat so we won't see as bad of an outcome from spammers as we did lately. This is more of a temporary fix, something more sophisticated will follow as soon as possible (survival, lobby, creative)
- Builders can now use '/pw set <warp_name>' as well as '/pw remove <warp_name>' again. This was apparently forgotten as the builders server was merged into creative. Only builders have access to create, delete and warp to them, regular users do not! (creative)

## 2025-01-12
### Fixed
- craftFlower now shows the heads for navigation properly again (creative)
### Added
- craftFlower has added the new blocks such as Hanging Roots, Moss Carpet and Pale Blocks (creative)
### Changed
- Elites no longer spawn glowing so you'll only see their nametag behind walls. This should hopefully make them less frightening and intrusive as the glowing effect can be pretty strong and irritating. I'm just experimenting with them right now, so bear with me while we're trying to figure their visuals out properly (survival)
- Elites are now zombies instead of creepers (survival)
- Elites now wear an orc custom skull to visualize that they're different (survival)
- Elites no longer have a chance of dropping their regular loot. This was mainly done as otherwise you could farm custom skulls with Elites (survival)

## 2025-01-10
### Changed
- You can now optimize and un-optimize villagers much quicker, the cooldown was previously set to 10 minutes, it is now 8 seconds (survival)
- Gunpowder and String was added to the Elite Shop (survival)
- People can now damage each other (PvP) even within the same town also known as friendly fire (survival)

## 2025-01-08
### Added
- Several more map arts were added to the map art shop (survival)
- A new Tutorial book explaining how merging towns works as it's been reason for confusion in the past (survival)

## 2025-01-07
### Added
- NPCs were added near the portals which let you join servers by simply clicking on them (lobby)
- Both the portals and the NPCs now tell you that you can use '/queue \<server\>' instead so if they ever fail, which they technically can, you still have the option to type in the command which works differently than the portals or the NPCs themselves. And while I could technically make them work the same way, that poses a security risk which is why it's not done (lobby)
### Removed
- The "Built by..." NPCs no longer open the Menu when clicked as it seems rather unintuitive and the compass already does that (lobby)

## 2025-01-06
### Fixed
- When opening shulker boxes within your inventory while standing on redstone ore wouldn't allow you to open them. That's now possible (survival)

## 2025-01-04
### Added
- Plugin to see plots on the online map through another plugin which doesn't seem to cause the lag the previous plugin did (creative)

## 2025-01-03
### Removed
- Plugin to see plots on the online map BUT it might make a return with another plugin. The reason was that it was causing periodical lag which is now gone (creative)

## 2025-01-01
### Added
- You can now buy spider eyes in the Elite Shop (survival)
- You can now buy phantom membranes in the Elite Shop (survival)
### Removed
- Bats no longer drop phantom membranes as they can now be bought in the Elite Shop (survival)

## 2024-12-31
### Added
- Unbreaking 6 has been added to the Custom Enchantments (survival)

## 2024-12-28
### Added
- You can now buy Bones in the Elite Shop. Expect more mob drops to make up for (intentionally) broken mob farms due to differently sized mobs (survival)
### Removed
- The plugin which allowed you to see farther. It turned out this plugin causes lag on connections with low bandwidth. (survival)
### Fixed
- Elite Coins were no longer accepted in the Elite Shop as the item data had changed since version 1.21.4 (that's something Mojang did). That should now be fixed (survival)
### Changed
- Some color adjustments to the output of commands such as '/fs <0-10>' (creative)

## 2024-12-27
### Added
- 1.21.4 support which adds all the 1.21.4/Pale Garden content! (survival, lobby)
- Speed Gear has been added to the Elite Shop (survival)
### Removed
- The plugin which allowed you to repair items for higher vanilla level cost was removed as it was too buggy, leading to unexpected and inconsistent outcomes of repairs (survival)
- Speed Crates have been removed from the Crates menu as it's been moved to the Elite Shop instead. Expect more cosmetic items in the Crates soon however :) (survival)

- **2024-07-19**

- * Salary Raise quests are now a little easier in terms of how many votes you need.
- **2024-07-17**

- * Unbreaking now goes up to level 5!
- **2024-07-06**
- The server now runs 1.21 so you can enjoy all the blocks, mobs and features it has!! Enjoy!! <3
- 
- - Chest Shops. The developer has stopped support but we're searching for a replacement
- - Daily Quests. It currently has a bug but it'll hopefully be resolved soon :)

- However mayors can not be kicked from the town and co-mayors and assistants will only be kicked if using flat taxes

- 
- * The -75% Skill XP that were mentioned for Easy Mode up until now were not active yet but have been made active now!
- These last two changes combined mean that playing in Easy Mode now means you'll have it harder than before to level up your skills but also that it's now easier if you play in hard mode.
