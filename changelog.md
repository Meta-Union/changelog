# Changelog
All notable changes to the Meta-Union Minecraft Network will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## 2024-12-27
### Added
- 1.21.4 support which adds all the 1.21.4/Pale Garden content! (survival, lobby)
### Removed
- The plugin which allowed you to repair items for higher vanilla level cost was removed as it was too buggy, leading to unexpected and inconsistent outcomes of repairs (survival)

## 2024-12-14
### Changed
- The water in Patpack's lobby is now bouncy, for no reason other than it being fun (lobby)

## 2024-12-07
### Changed
- You now spawn in the Christmas lobby when joining the lobby and are greeted with a firework explosion (lobby)

## 2024-12-06
### Added
- Meta-Union now supports Java clients 1.21.4 as well as Bedrock Edition 1.21.50 (all servers)
- A new allowance was added to '/rules' which mentions that you're allowed to host events on Meta-Union within your abilities. This was always allowed but I thought it might help to make it clear (all servers)
