## Survival's Changelogs up to 2024-12-21 (this isn't pretty and it isn't even supposed to be... but it'll stay this way unless someone takes the time to make it pretty)

- **2024-08-30**

- **2024-08-25**
- * Custom Enchantments now only need one quest to unlock, not a separate one for each slot anymore.
- **2024-08-21**

- - Hasten is no longer obtainable through custom enchants
- - Custom enchants can no longer be toggled through the menu
- **2024-07-19**
- - You can no longer obtain Timber from '/e' as it has too many incompatibilities, sorry :(
- * Second Salary Raise quest now requires votes instead of daily quests as daily quests will be removed soon.
- * Salary Raise quests are now a little easier in terms of how many votes you need.
- **2024-07-17**
- - You can no longer obtain Replanter from '/e'
- * Mining gives way less armor durability protection, back to the default of the skill plugin! Use Unbreaking 5 on your armor for it to last :P

- **2024-07-16**

- **2024-07-08**
- * Mayors now also pay town taxes but they can never be kicked from the town! This is mainly so your town doesn't die while you are away and there was money left in the mayor's pockets.
- **2024-07-07**
- * Unbreaking now goes up to level 5!
- **2024-07-06**
- The server now runs 1.21 so you can enjoy all the blocks, mobs and features it has!! Enjoy!! <3
- 
- - Chest Shops. The developer has stopped support but we're searching for a replacement
- - Daily Quests. It currently has a bug but it'll hopefully be resolved soon :)
- + Exploration Maps work again but they can lead to similar/already generated structures!
- * Opening Angel Chests only costs 50 MetaCoins from now on!
- * Reworked Hard Mode and Easy Mode, the latter is now called Vanilla Mode.
- + Added Extreme Mode which is only available with at least 100 hours playtime.
- **2024-06-25**
- + Unbreaking 4 can now be made by combining 2 Unbreaking 3 books in an anvil!
- - Reforged, Nylon Thread and Reinforced have been removed due to Unbreaking which will slowly replace it
- * Town bankruptcy has been simplified. You now have 14 days when going bankrupt and afterwards your town's deleted.
- * Mayors, co-mayors and Assistants now also pay taxes unless they give themselves the tax-evader rank.
- However mayors can not be kicked from the town and co-mayors and assistants will only be kicked if using flat taxes
- * TSMs have been reduced to a 20% multiplier as skills are now generally easier than previously.
- * Plots now automatically get set up for sale if the owner can't pay the taxes
- * The XP Convert skill of Enchanting has been changed, its formula now makes it so that you still have a pretty strong start and allows for up to 4x the vanilla exp at max level compared to the first level
- **2024-06-24**
- + Newbies can now teleport to their Angel Chests (for the first 4 hours of playtime)
- - Boss Mobs have been removed as I do not have enough time to properly maintain or integrate them, maybe another day...
- 
- + Newbies with less than 4 hours of playtime can now use '/rtp' and '/tpa <user>'
- * Skills are generally 2.5x easier to level up than previously!
- 
- * The -75% Skill XP that were mentioned for Easy Mode up until now were not active yet but have been made active now!
- These last two changes combined mean that playing in Easy Mode now means you'll have it harder than before to level up your skills but also that it's now easier if you play in hard mode.
